# knowledge-platform

A platform for users to create repositories of knowledge, ideas, information, in an open and collaborative way.

---

I open the site, I can login into my account but for now Im just viewing the homepage… there is a search bar front and center that says "Search Knowledge", I enter a query such as 'Topology" and am presented with public facing repositories that contain keywords of 'topology', I can pin or favourite any repository or decide to categorise them but another filter such as date, user, and extra keywords.

Since I’m not logged in, scrolling down the landing page shows information about the site, beautifully formatted and concise.

When Im logged in, I can edit my profile, view my dashboard of pinned repositories, create private or public facing repositories, or create my own notes… there are channels to follow or collaborate on for public repos, or on my private repos where i can add other user too. Hence, I create a team to share one of my knowledge repos on QM with.

I can see links to integrate with other products as well.

A user can have websites, tools, products and ideas on their profile/account that they want to share and to build 'value' points within the community. For example, my profile has links to whitepapers I find useful or intereting, or a link to a new GitLab feature documentation that is something I talk about wanting to use etc...

Given the social element, how is this hosted? Matrix? Decentralised?

- GitHub x Obsidean ->

Think of a Github like platform where you create 'knowledge' based repos, around math, science, or even coding
Repos can be private or public
Repos can integrate straight to github/bitbucket etc... so that some of your repos may be knowledge while others that are code you can use trusted github
Homepage could have 'Search to Learn...' style functionality that allows a user to basically search through public repos (or include their own private repos\*\*\*) for information related to their search

\*\*\* a users 'knowledge' repo may consist of 'dumps' of information that needs to be sorted and formatted -> a tool that does this as a feature?

KEY FEATURES

1. User can create a repo for storing any information, like Cloud storage but built to format work in a repository of knowledge.
2. Files can be any format including .java, .js, .cc, etc and even markdown, or image files
3. Repositories can be public or private
4. Social element built around public repos, Reddit style and also around private repos by creating teams.
5. Global "Search Knowledge..." can search public repos for related queries
6. Repos can be searched and sorted in categories.

KEY USERS

1. Engineers and developers (integration with common products such as Github/Lab)
2. University students and staff for collaboration on archives and new ideas
3. Geeks (I'd be using it)

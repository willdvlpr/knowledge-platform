# knowledge-platform

A platform for users to create repositories of knowledge and ideas, that can be shared and collaborated on.

---

### Key Features

1. User can create a repo for storing any information, like cloud storage but built to format work in a repository of knowledge.
2. Files can be any format including .java, .js, .cc, .txt, .xls, etc and even markdown, or image files.
3. Repositories can be public or private.
4. Social element built around public repositories while private repositories can have their own teams.
5. Global "Search Knowledge..." function that can search public repositories for related queries.
6. Repositories can be searched and sorted in categories.
7. Integration with other site such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket for linking a code repository.

### Example Use

I open the site, I can login into my account but for now I'm just viewing the homepage… there is a search bar front and center that says "Search Knowledge...", I enter a query such as 'Topology" and am presented with public facing repositories that contain keywords of 'topology', I can pin or 'favourite' any repository or decide to categorise them by another filter such as date, user, and extra keywords.

Since I’m not logged in, scrolling down the landing page shows information about the site, beautifully formatted and concise.

When Im logged in, I can edit my profile, view my dashboard of pinned repositories, create private or public facing repositories, or create my own notes… there are channels to follow or collaborate on for public repositories, or on my private repositories where I can add other user too. Hence, I create a team to share one of my knowledge repositories on a topic with.

I can see links to integrate with other products as well.

A user can have websites, tools, products and ideas on their profile/account that they want to share and to build 'value' points within the community. For example, my profile has links to whitepapers I find useful or intereting, or a link to a new GitLab feature documentation that is something I talk about wanting to use..

# knowledge-platform

A platform for users to create repositories of knowledge, ideas, information, in an open and collaborative way.

---

- GitHub x Obsidean ->

Think of a Github like platform where you create 'knowledge' based repos, around math, science, or even coding
Repos can be private or public
Repos can integrate straight to github/bitbucket etc... so that some of your repos may be knowledge while others that are code you can use trusted github
Homepage could have 'Search to Learn...' style functionality that allows a user to basically search through public repos (or include their own private repos\*\*\*) for information related to their search

\*\*\* a users 'knowledge' repo may consist of 'dumps' of information that needs to be sorted and formatted -> a tool that does this as a feature?

KEY FEATURES

1. User can create a repo for storing any information, like Cloud storage but built to format work in a repository of knowledge.
2. Files can be any format including .java, .js, .cc, etc and even markdown, or image files
3. Repositories can be public or private
4. Social element built around public repos, Reddit style and also around private repos by creating teams.
5. Global "Search Knowledge..." can search public repos for related queries
6. Repos can be searched and sorted in categories.

KEY USERS

1. Engineers and developers (integration with common products such as Github/Lab)
2. University students and staff for collaboration on archives and new ideas
3. Geeks (I'd be using it)
